# Object Oriented Programming (contd..)
- 4 Pillars of OOP

## Encapsulation
- Technique of keeping internal state of object hidden from the outside.
- Achieved using private attributes and providing public methods to access and update them.
- Syntax: __varname

## Abstraction
- Concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. 
- Achieved by using Abstract class and method.

### Abstraction Class and Method

## Inheritance
- Mechanism of creating a new class based on an exisiting class, by inheriting properties (attributes and/or methods)
- Parent class: The class from where the features are inherited from.
- Child class: The class that inherits the features.
- Benefits: Classes are created easily, easy maintenance.

## Polymorphism
- Ability to present the same interface for different data types.
- Allows methods to do diferrent things based on the object it is acting upon.
